Machine Learning Projects 

The machine learning model predict whether the customers gets its railway ticket confirm or not 
Based on the various features .


This in this projets we gathered public datasets (dataframe.csv)

Its contain features and label for model traning :
Contributing features:travelClass,bookingStatus,status1Day,status1Month,status1Week,status2Days
Class : labels ( whether ticket will confirm or not)

Model training : train logistic regression (binary classification) 
Model evaluation : Tested model on test datasets shows 94 % accuracy
